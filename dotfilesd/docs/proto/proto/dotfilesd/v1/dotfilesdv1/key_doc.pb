dotfilesd.v1.KeyServiceëKeyService provides ephemeral ECDH key negotiation over insecure channels.
Keys are never exposed over the wire â€” only public keys are exchanged,
and both sides derive the same shared secret locally.

The shared secret is associated with a (session, key_id) pair and can be
used for AES-256-GCM encryption/decryption or HMAC signing/verification
on either side.‡
NegotiateKey­NegotiateKey performs an ephemeral X25519 ECDH key exchange.
The client sends its public key and a unique key_id; the daemon
generates its own ephemeral keypair, derives the shared secret,
stores it for the session+key_id, and returns its public key.
The client derives the same shared secret locally. dotfilesd.v1.NegotiateKeyRequest"!dotfilesd.v1.NegotiateKeyResponse*‘
